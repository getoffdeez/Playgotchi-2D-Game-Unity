# Playgotchi-2D-Game-Unity

The objective of the game is to shoot as many ships as you can without letting them hit you.

    Use the left,  and right arrow keys to move
    To shoot the ships,  click K.  Each time you successfully destroy a ship, you earn 50 points. 

Be careful not to get hit by the ships bullets, as they will cause you to lose a life.
